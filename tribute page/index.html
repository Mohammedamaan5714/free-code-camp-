      <p>
        Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine, making her the first to be recognized as a computer programmer.

        Lovelace was born on December 10, 1815, and showed her mathematical talent early in life. Her mother, Annabella Byron, insisted she receive a strong education in mathematics and science. Ada married William King-Noel, and upon his becoming Earl of Lovelace, she became Countess of Lovelace.

        Her contributions to computing were not recognized until a century after her death. In 1953, her notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished, and she was recognized as a pioneer in the field of computer science.
